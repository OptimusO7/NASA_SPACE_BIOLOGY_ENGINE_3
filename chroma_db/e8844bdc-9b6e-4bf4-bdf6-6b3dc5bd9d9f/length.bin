Common Pathways between Simulated Space Radiation and Spaceﬂight Samples To fully understand the speciﬁc and long-lasting effects of space radiation on biology, we have to understand the general pathways that are being regulated. We ﬁrst utilized gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [ 46] to determine signiﬁcant pathways being regulated for each condition with an
